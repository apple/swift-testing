Highlight known issues when running tests.

## Overview

The testing library provides a function, `withKnownIssue()`, that you
use to mark issues as known. In other words, if you know a test records an
issue, might record an issue intermittently (a "flaky" test), or tests code in 
your project that is incomplete, use this function to inform the testing library 
at runtime not to mark the test as failing when those issues occur.
