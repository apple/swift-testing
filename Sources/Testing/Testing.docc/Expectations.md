Check for expected values and outcomes in tests.

## Overview

The testing library provides `#expect()` and `#require()` macros you use to 
validate expected outcomes. To validate that an error is thrown, or _not_ thrown, 
the testing library provides several overloads of the macros that you can use.
Use a ``Confirmation`` to confirm the occurrence of an asynchronous event that
you can't check directly using an expectation.

## Topics

### Checking expectations

- ``expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)``
- ``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-5l63q``
- ``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-6w9oo``

### Checking expected throws

- ``expect(throws:_:sourceLocation:performing:)-79piu``
- ``expect(throws:_:sourceLocation:performing:)-1xr34``
- ``expect(_:sourceLocation:performing:throws:)``
- ``expect(throws:_:sourceLocation:performing:)-5lzjz``
- ``require(throws:_:sourceLocation:performing:)-76bjn``
- ``require(throws:_:sourceLocation:performing:)-7v83e``
- ``require(_:sourceLocation:performing:throws:)``
- ``require(throws:_:sourceLocation:performing:)-36uzc``

### Confirming asynchronous events

- ``confirmation(_:expectedCount:fileID:filePath:line:column:_:)``
- ``Confirmation``

### Retrieving information about checked expectations

- ``Expectation``
- ``ExpectationFailedError``
- ``CustomTestStringConvertible``
- ``Expression``

### Representing source locations

- ``SourceLocation``
- ``SourceContext``
- ``Backtrace``
