## Introduction

A key requirement for the success of any developer platform is a way to use
automated testing to identify software defects. Better APIs and tools for
testing can greatly improve a platformâ€™s quality. Below, we propose a new API
direction for testing in Swift.

by the Swift Language Steering Group and is now hosted in the
