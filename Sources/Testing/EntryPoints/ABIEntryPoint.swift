/// - Parameters:
///   - argumentsJSON: A buffer to memory representing the JSON encoding of an
///     instance of `__CommandLineArguments_v0`. If `nil`, a new instance is
///     created from the command-line arguments to the current process.
///   - eventHandler: An event handler to which is passed a buffer to memory
///     representing each event and its context, as with ``Event/Handler``, but
///     encoded as JSON.
///
/// - Returns: The result of invoking the testing library. The type of this
///   value is subject to change.
///
/// This function examines the command-line arguments to the current process
/// and then invokes available tests in the current process.
///
/// - Warning: This function's signature and the structure of its JSON inputs
///   and outputs have not been finalized yet.

/// - Returns: A pointer to an instance of that type representing the ABI-stable

///   responsible for deinitializing and deallocating it when done.
///
/// This function can be used by tools that do not link directly to the testing

/// `"swt_copyABIEntryPoint_v0"` and can be dynamically looked up at runtime
/// using `dlsym()` or a platform equivalent.
///
/// The returned function can be thought of as equivalent to
/// `swift test --experimental-event-stream-output` except that, instead of
/// streaming events to a named pipe or file, it streams them to a callback.
